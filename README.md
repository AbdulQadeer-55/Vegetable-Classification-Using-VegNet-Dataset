# Vegetable-Classification-Using-VegNet-Dataset
I have developed the classification model for categorizing vegetables into 19 labels by using TensorFlow, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. And, built web application which accepts the image and provide outcome in the corresponding labels along with percentage of all the labels which matches the features.
